# Creating a final report

## A quarto book

Quarto Books are combinations of multiple documents (chapters) into a single manuscript. Books can be created in a variety of formats:

-   HTML
-   PDF
-   MS Word
-   EPUB

## Workflow

We will check the steps to create and edit a simple book with chapters contained in the files `index.qmd`, `intro.qmd`, `summary.qmd`.

**Config File**

A Quarto project file (`_quarto.yml`) is contained within the book project directory. This file contains the initial configuration for your book. For example:

```         
---
project:
  type: book
book:
  title: "GIS with R"
  author: "Moinul Islam"
  date: "4/18/2024"
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - intro.qmd
    - summary.qmd
    - references.qmd
bibliography: references.bib
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
  pdf:
    documentclass: scrreprt
  epub:
    cover-image: cover.png
---
```

## Book Structure

The structure of a Quarto book can be as simple as a list of chapters, or can alternatively incorporate multiple parts and/or appendices. Quarto book chapters and sections are automatically numbered (for cross-referencing), however you can also specify that some parts of the book should remain unnumbered.

The simple book configuration generated by quarto create project book illustrates the basics:

```         
---
book:
  title: "GIS with R"
  author: "Moinul Islam"
  date: "5/9/2021"
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - intro.qmd
    - summary.qmd
    - references.qmd
---
```

The `index.qmd` file is required (because Quarto books also produce a website in HTML format). The `references.qmd` file will include the generated bibliography.

**Titles**

Since rendering options are provided in \_quarto.yml, youâ€™ll typically see a simple level-one header at the top of chapters. For example:

```         
# Introduction
```

Note that the following is also still perfectly valid:

```         
---
title: "Introduction"
---
```

In the absence of a level-one header or a title set in the YAML front matter, the first header in the page will be used as the title.

**Chapter Numbers**

All chapters are numbered by default. If you want a chapter to be unnumbered simply add the .unnumbered class to its main header. For example:

```{txt}
# Introduction {.unnumbered}
```

**Section Numbers**

You can set the numbering depth via the number-depth option. For example, to only number sections immediately below the chapter level, use this:

```{txt}
number-depth: 1
```

**Creating an Index**

To add an index to the PDF output for a book, add these include-in-header and include-after-body entries to your pdf format configuration in \_quarto.yml: quart

```         
---
format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
  pdf:
    documentclass: scrreprt
    include-in-header: 
      text: |
        \usepackage{makeidx}
        \makeindex
    include-after-body: 
      text: |
        \printindex
---
```

**Parts & Appendices**

You can divide your book into parts using part within the book chapters. For example:

```         
---
chapters:
  - index.qmd
  - preface.qmd
  - part: dice.qmd
    chapters: 
      - basics.qmd
      - packages.qmd
  - part: cards.qmd
    chapters:
      - objects.qmd
      - notation.qmd
      - modifying.qmd
      - environments.qmd
---
```

You can include appendices by adding an appendices key to your book config. For example:

```         
---
book:
  title: "GIS with R"
  author: "Moinul Islam"
  date: "5/9/2024"
  chapters:
    - index.qmd
    - intro.qmd
    - summary.qmd
    - references.qmd
  appendices:
    - tools.qmd
    - resources.qmd
---
```

**Navigation bar**

Options that define the top navigation bar for a book For example:

```         
---
book:
  navbar:
    search: true
---
```

**Navigation items**

Nav items appear in the left or right key of navbar definitions, or contents key of sidebar definitions. For example:

```         
---
book:
  navbar:
    right:
      - icon: github
        href: https://github.com/
        aria-label: GitHub
---
```

**Sidebar**

Options that define the side navigation area for a book. For example:

```         
---
book:
  sidebar:
    search: true
---
```

**Sidebar Tools**

Action buttons that appear on the sidebar. For example:

```         
---
book:
  sidebar:
    tools:
      - icon: github
        href: https://github.com/
---
```
