# Preface {.unnumbered}

We have entered the age of geoeconomics, in which the global economy has become fused with geopolitical strategy. Geoeconomics have impact not only on the public policy, but also on the management of private sector companies that do business globally. Hundreds of thousands of organizations are using geographic information system (GIS) to make maps that communicate, perform analysis, share information, and solve complex problems around the world. This geoeconomics course basically deals with GIS, a spatial system that creates, manages, analyzes, and maps all types of data. Every day, GIS powers millions of decisions around the world. It makes a big impact on our lives and you might not even realize it.

The "Geoeconomics" course contents are as below:

-   Lecture 1: R packages for GIS

-   Lecture 2: Processing Shapefiles in R

-   Lecture 3: Making maps with R

-   Lecture 4: Part 1_Spatial data operations

-   Lecture 5: Part 2_Spatial data operations

-   Lecture 6: Part 1_Making map of Tokyo

-   Lecture 7: Part 2_Making map of Tokyo

-   Lecture 8: Part 1_Making map with `sf`

-   Lecture 9: Part 2_Making map with `sf`

-   Lecture 10: Part 1_Plotting U.S.A. Map

-   Lecture 11: Part 2_Plotting U.S.A. Map

-   Lecture 12: Part 1_Spatial analysis using `sf`

-   Lecture 13: Part 2_Spatial analysis using `sf`

-   Lecture 14: Part 3_Spatial analysis using `sf`

-   Lecture 15: Population density maps

This lecture is for the readers who want to analyze, visualize and model geographic data with open source software. It is based on **R** that has powerful data processing, visualization and geospatial capabilities. The lecture is divided into three parts:

-   Part I: Foundations, aimed at getting you up-to-speed with geographic data in R
-   Part II: Extensions, which covers intermediate techniques
-   Part III: Applications, to real-world problems

Geo-computation with **R** will equip you with knowledge and skills to tackle a wide range of issues, including those with scientific, societal and environmental implications, manifested in geographic data.

### Course logistic

Class schedule in 1Q:

### Grading

Your grade evaluation will depend on following three factors:

| Performance                    | Weight |
|--------------------------------|--------|
| a\. Attendance                 | 10%    |
| b\. Answering the assignments. | 40%    |
| c\. Final examination (TBA)    | 50%    |

### Assignment submission

Regarding the assignments, you have to write in English to get evaluated. Writing with logical explanation and examples are the main criteria of evaluation. If you can create exceptional arguments to support your discussion, I will provide bonus points for that assignment.
