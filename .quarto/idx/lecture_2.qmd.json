Here are a few key reasons:\n\n**Data Representation:** Shapefile is a popular file format for storing and sharing geospatial data. It allows the representation of complex geographic features such as points, lines, and polygons, along with their attributes.\n\n**Interoperability:** Shapefile is supported by a wide range of GIS software, making it highly inter-operable. It enables data exchange between different systems and facilitates collaboration among users who may be using different GIS platforms.\n\n**Attribute Management:** Shapefile supports the storage of attribute data associated with geographic features. This allows for the integration of non-spatial information, such as population, land use, or temperature, with spatial data, enabling comprehensive analysis and visualization.\n\n**Compact and Efficient:** Shapefiles are relatively small in size compared to other data formats, making them efficient for storing and transferring geospatial data. They are also capable of handling large data-sets without compromising performance.\n\n**Historical Significance:** Shapefile has been in use for several decades and has become a standard in the GIS community. Many legacy datasets and applications are based on shapefiles, making them crucial for historical data preservation and compatibility.\n\n## Shapefile and R\n\nShapefile is commonly used with R, a powerful programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Here's why shapefile is often preferred for use with R:\n\n**Native Support:** R has built-in support for reading, writing, and manipulating shapefiles. The \"sf\" package in R provides functions specifically designed for working with spatial data, including shapefiles. This native support simplifies the process of loading shapefiles into R and performing various spatial analyses.\n\n**Visualization Capabilities:** R offers extensive visualization capabilities for geospatial data. Packages like \"ggplot2\" and \"leaflet\" enable you to create high-quality maps and interactive visualizations using shapefiles as the data source. R's flexibility in customizing plots allows for advanced geospatial visualizations and exploration.\n\n> While shapefile is a common choice for working with spatial data in R, it's important to note that R also supports other geospatial file formats, such as GeoJSON and Geopackage. These formats may offer advantages like improved data compression, support for more advanced spatial features, and better inter-operability with certain software ecosystems.\n\n-   Use `pacman` to manage the R packages\n\n-   Using `packman` package enables us to install and load a package without typing `install.packges()` at Console on your RStudio\n\n-   You need to type the following command at Console on your RStudio\n\n```{txt}\ninstall.packages(\"pacman\")\n```\n\n-   The installation of necessary R packages:\n\n```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}\n#| code-fold: false\npacman::p_load(sf, tidyverse, rnaturalearth)\n```\n\n## Using `sf` package to make map\n\n-   Create data for world\n\n```{r}\n#| code-fold: false\nworld <- ne_countries(scale = \"small\", returnclass = \"sf\")\n```\n\n-   First we use the familiar ggplot2 syntax.
