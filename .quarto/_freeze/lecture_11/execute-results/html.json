Books can be created in a variety of formats:\n\n-   HTML\n-   PDF\n-   MS Word\n-   EPUB\n\n## Workflow\n\nWe will check the steps to create and edit a simple book with chapters contained in the files `index.qmd`, `intro.qmd`, `summary.qmd`.\n\n**Config File**\n\nA Quarto project file (`_quarto.yml`) is contained within the book project directory. This file contains the initial configuration for your book. For example:\n\n```         \n---\nproject:\n  type: book\nbook:\n  title: \"GIS with R\"\n  author: \"Moinul Islam\"\n  date: \"4/18/2024\"\n  chapters:\n    - index.qmd\n    - intro.qmd\n    - summary.qmd\n    - references.qmd\nbibliography: references.bib\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n  pdf:\n    documentclass: scrreprt\n  epub:\n    cover-image: cover.png\n---\n```\n\n## Book Structure\n\nThe structure of a Quarto book can be as simple as a list of chapters, or can alternatively incorporate multiple parts and/or appendices. Quarto book chapters and sections are automatically numbered (for cross-referencing), however you can also specify that some parts of the book should remain unnumbered.\n\nThe simple book configuration generated by quarto create project book illustrates the basics:\n\n```         \n---\nbook:\n  title: \"GIS with R\"\n  author: \"Moinul Islam\"\n  date: \"5/9/2021\"\n  chapters:\n    - index.qmd\n    - intro.qmd\n    - summary.qmd\n    - references.qmd\n---\n```\n\nThe `index.qmd` file is required (because Quarto books also produce a website in HTML format). The `references.qmd` file will include the generated bibliography.\n\n**Titles**\n\nSince rendering options are provided in \\_quarto.yml, youâ€™ll typically see a simple level-one header at the top of chapters. For example:\n\n```         \n# Introduction\n```\n\nNote that the following is also still perfectly valid:\n\n```         \n---\ntitle: \"Introduction\"\n---\n```\n\nIn the absence of a level-one header or a title set in the YAML front matter, the first header in the page will be used as the title.\n\n**Chapter Numbers**\n\nAll chapters are numbered by default. If you want a chapter to be unnumbered simply add the .unnumbered class to its main header. For example:\n\n\n\n```{txt}\n# Introduction {.unnumbered}\n```\n\n\n\n**Section Numbers**\n\nYou can set the numbering depth via the number-depth option. For example, to only number sections immediately below the chapter level, use this:\n\n\n\n```{txt}\nnumber-depth: 1\n```\n\n\n\n**Creating an Index**\n\nTo add an index to the PDF output for a book, add these include-in-header and include-after-body entries to your pdf format configuration in \\_quarto.yml: quart\n\n```         \n---\nformat:\n  html:\n    theme: cosmo\n  pdf:\n    documentclass: scrreprt\n    include-in-header: \n      text: |\n        \\usepackage{makeidx}\n        \\makeindex\n    include-after-body: \n      text: |\n        \\printindex\n---\n```\n\n**Parts & Appendices**\n\nYou can divide your book into parts using part within the book chapters. For example:\n\n```         \n---\nchapters:\n  - index.qmd\n  - preface.qmd\n  - part: dice.qmd\n    chapters: \n      - basics.qmd\n      - packages.qmd\n  - part: cards.qmd\n    chapters:\n      - objects.qmd\n      - notation.qmd\n      - modifying.qmd\n      - environments.qmd\n---\n```\n\nYou can include appendices by adding an appendices key to your book config. For example:\n\n```         \n---\nbook:\n  title: \"GIS with R\"\n  author: \"Moinul Islam\"\n  date: \"5/9/2024\"\n  chapters:\n    - index.qmd\n    - intro.qmd\n    - summary.qmd\n    - references.qmd\n  appendices:\n    - tools.qmd\n    - resources.qmd\n---\n```\n\n**Navigation bar**\n\nOptions that define the top navigation bar for a book For example:\n\n```         \n---\nbook:\n  navbar:\n    search: true\n---\n```\n\n**Navigation items**\n\nNav items appear in the left or right key of navbar definitions, or contents key of sidebar definitions. For example:\n\n```         \n---\nbook:\n  navbar:\n    right:\n      - icon: github\n        href: https://github.com/\n        aria-label: GitHub\n---\n```\n\n**Sidebar**\n\nOptions that define the side navigation area for a book. For example:\n\n```         \n---\nbook:\n  sidebar:\n    search: true\n---\n```\n\n**Sidebar Tools**\n\nAction buttons that appear on the sidebar. For example:\n\n```         \n---\nbook:\n  sidebar:\n    tools:\n      - icon: github\n        href: https://github.com/\n---\n```\n\n",
